    <p>Based on my previous working experience, I have became a full stack programmer which can work on both Front-end and Back-end side development, server administraion, monitoring and system architecture. I am familiar with different kind of PHP MVC framework, such as <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/" target="_blank">Yii</a>, <a href="http://cakephp.org/" target="_blank">CakePHP</a>. On front-end side, I have used  <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a> and <a href="https://greensock.com/" target="_blank">Greensock</a> for development. Moreover, I also gained experience on <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal CMS</a>. On the other hand, I am also comfortable working with Linux environment.</p>

    <p>With curiosity which never satisfy, I always explore on different kind of web technology. Now I am interested in some state of the art technology. Now I am impressed by <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Golang</a> which is a high performance and concurrent programming language. I am also a fan of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. </p>
